        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This project was my first attempt at analyzing stroke fMRI data using OpenNeuro datasets. 
            My goal was to visualize brain activity changes before and after rehabilitation therapy.
        </p>
        <p>
            The dataset I used is from OpenNeuro:  
            <strong>Daminov V. (MD, PhD), Novak E. (MD, MSc), Slepnyova N. (MD), Mikhailov D. (MSc), Karpulevich E. (MSc) (2022).

    <!-- Challenges & Issues Faced -->
    <section class="card">
        <h2>Challenges & Lessons Learned</h2>
        <p>
            This project had many hurdles. My original goal was to precisely locate the stroke lesion  
            and analyze its changes post-therapy. However, aligning the lesion mask with the fMRI scans  
            proved difficult, resulting in visualization errors.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some of the key challenges:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Difficulty aligning the pre- and post-stroke scans accurately.</li>
            <li>Struggles in overlaying lesion masks correctly.</li>
            <li>Colab crashing due to large fMRI file sizes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Despite these issues, I successfully visualized pre- and post-therapy fMRI differences  
            and performed voxel-wise analysis. This was an exciting first step in combining coding  
            with neuroscience!
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Code Implementation Section -->
    <section class="card">
        <h2>Code Implementation</h2>
        <p>Below is the Python code I used for processing and analyzing the fMRI data.</p>
        <pre>
<code>
import nibabel as nib
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load fMRI scans
fmri_pre = nib.load("sub-01_ses-pre_task-rest_bold.nii.gz")
fmri_post = nib.load("sub-01_ses-post_task-rest_bold.nii.gz")

# Convert to numpy arrays
fmri_pre_data = fmri_pre.get_fdata()
fmri_post_data = fmri_post.get_fdata()

# Compute voxel-wise difference
fmri_diff = fmri_post_data - fmri_pre_data

# Select middle slice for visualization
slice_idx = fmri_diff.shape[-1] // 2
diff_slice = fmri_diff[:, :, fmri_diff.shape[2] // 2, slice_idx]

# Plot the voxel-wise difference
plt.imshow(diff_slice.T, cmap="seismic", origin="lower", vmin=-500, vmax=500)
plt.colorbar(label="BOLD Signal Change")
plt.title("Voxel-Wise Difference: Post - Pre fMRI")
plt.show()
</code>

    <!-- Conclusions -->
    <section class="card">
        <h2>Conclusions</h2>
        <p>
            This project represents my first deep dive into fMRI data analysis and neuroscience coding.  
            While there were setbacks in lesion localization, I successfully performed voxel-wise  
            statistical comparisons and visualized changes in brain activity post-rehabilitation.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the future, I hope to improve lesion segmentation, explore different stroke datasets,  
            and refine my analytical methods!

    <h2>Failed Attempts: Challenges in Visualizing the Lesion</h2>
    <p>
        Throughout this project, I ran into several roadblocks when trying to correctly visualize the lesion. 
        I attempted multiple approaches, adjusting different parameters, but often the lesion was misaligned, missing, or incorrectly overlaid.
    </p>

    <h3>Example of Failed Visualizations</h3>
    <p>Here are some of my unsuccessful attempts to overlay the lesion on the post-stroke MRI scan:</p>

    <div class="image-gallery">
        <figure>
            <img src="images/Failed attempt 1.png" alt="Failed Attempt 1">
            <figcaption>First attempt – The lesion was not visible at all.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure>
            <img src="images/Failed attempt 2.png" alt="Failed Attempt 2">
            <figcaption>Second attempt – Misalignment of lesion mask with the brain.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure>
            <img src="images/Failed attempt 3.png" alt="Failed Attempt 3">
            <figcaption>Third attempt – The lesion appears outside the brain structure.</figcaption>
        </figure>
    </div>

    <h3>Code That Didn't Work</h3>
    <p>
        One of the major issues was aligning the lesion mask with the MRI scan. 
        Below is a snippet of an early failed approach where the resampling caused misalignment.
    </p>
    
    <pre>
import nibabel as nib
from nilearn.image import resample_to_img

# Load images
lesion_mask = nib.load("lesion_mask.nii.gz")
post_mri = nib.load("sub-01_ses-post_T1w.nii.gz")

# Attempt to resample (This led to misalignment)
resampled_lesion_mask = resample_to_img(lesion_mask, post_mri, interpolation="nearest")

# Displaying the lesion mask caused incorrect overlay
    </pre>

    <p>
        The issue turned out to be mismatched affine matrices between the fMRI scan and the lesion mask.
        This resulted in the lesion appearing in the wrong part of the image or even outside the brain structure.
    </p>

    <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ensuring affine matrices are correctly aligned is crucial when working with MRI data.</li>
        <li>Visualization issues often stem from preprocessing errors, not just the dataset itself.</li>
        <li>Debugging medical imaging data requires patience and iteration, especially when dealing with multi-dimensional data.</li>
    </ul>

        <!-- Note on My Learning Process -->
    <section class="card">
        <h2>Note on My Learning Process</h2>
        <p>
            As I dive into fMRI analysis, I am actively learning coding through multiple platforms.  
            I use resources like:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/" target="_blank">Kaggle</a> for hands-on data science challenges</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/" target="_blank">Coursera</a> for structured courses</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a> for troubleshooting</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3Schools</a> for quick coding references</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Additionally, I leverage **ChatGPT** as a tool to help me debug, optimize,  
            and understand complex coding concepts. By integrating these resources,  
            I am taking a **practical, hands-on approach** to learning neuroscience data analysis.
