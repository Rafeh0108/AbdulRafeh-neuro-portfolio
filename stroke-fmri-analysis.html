        <h1>Stroke fMRI Analysis</h1>
        <p>My early exploration into neuroscience and coding using publicly available fMRI data.</p>

            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>This project was my first attempt at analyzing stroke fMRI data using OpenNeuro datasets. My goal was to visualize brain activity changes before and after rehabilitation therapy.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>fMRI Pre-Therapy Scan</h2>
            <p>This is a brain slice from the fMRI scan taken before stroke rehabilitation.</p>

            <h2>Voxel-Wise Differences (Post - Pre fMRI)</h2>
            <p>This heatmap visualizes the difference in brain activity between post-therapy and pre-therapy scans.</p>

            <h2>Statistical Findings</h2>
            <p>Here is the distribution of voxel-wise BOLD signal changes. Most changes were minor, with some areas showing significant variations.</p>

            <h2>Identifying the Lesion</h2>
            <p>We attempted to overlay the lesion mask on the post-stroke MRI, but encountered alignment challenges.</p>

            <h2>Key Insights & Interpretation</h2>
            <p>Here is the summary of our findings and what we can infer.</p>

            <h2>Challenges & Future Work</h2>
            <p>While we made some progress, we faced issues with lesion localization and full therapy interpretation.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We couldn't precisely align the lesion mask with the MRI.</li>
                <li>Finding detailed information on the exact rehabilitation therapy was challenging.</li>
                <li>This was an early step in my journey into neuroscience data analysis.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Next steps include improving alignment techniques and exploring stroke therapy details further.</p>
