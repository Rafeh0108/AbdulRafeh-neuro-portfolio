    <section class="card">
        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This project was my first attempt at analyzing stroke fMRI data using OpenNeuro datasets. My goal was to visualize
            brain activity changes before and after rehabilitation therapy.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Pre-Therapy fMRI Scan -->
    <section class="card">
        <h2>fMRI Pre-Therapy Scan</h2>
        <p>This is a brain slice from the fMRI scan taken before stroke rehabilitation.</p>

    <!-- Post-Therapy fMRI Scan -->
    <section class="card">
        <h2>fMRI Post-Therapy Scan</h2>
        <p>This is a brain slice from the fMRI scan after rehabilitation therapy.</p>

            The heatmap below represents the voxel-wise difference between post- and pre-therapy fMRI scans. Red regions indicate increased
            activity post-therapy, while blue regions indicate decreased activity.

        <h2>Statistical Analysis of Changes</h2>
        <p>
            This histogram quantifies how much the BOLD signal changed across all voxels. The average change was <strong>~1.65</strong>, meaning there was
            a slight overall increase in activation, with some regions showing more extreme changes.

    <!-- The Process (How I Did It) -->
    <section class="card">
        <h2>How I Did This Analysis</h2>
        <p>
            This project involved several key steps:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Finding a relevant fMRI dataset from <a href="https://openneuro.org">OpenNeuro</a>.</li>
            <li>Using Python (Nilearn, Nibabel, Matplotlib) to process and visualize the data.</li>
            <li>Extracting slices from 4D fMRI data and comparing voxel-wise differences.</li>
            <li>Creating a histogram to summarize changes in brain activity.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Challenges & Failures -->
    <section class="card">
        <h2>What Didn’t Work</h2>
        <p>
            Not everything went smoothly! Some major setbacks I faced:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Struggled to correctly align pre- and post-therapy MRI scans, leading to some misaligned comparisons.</li>
            <li>Failed attempts at visualizing the lesion location due to mismatched affine transformations.</li>
            <li>Initially, my voxel-wise change visualization wasn’t highlighting differences correctly.</li>
            <li>Spent too much time debugging color mapping instead of focusing on meaningful interpretations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These challenges taught me a lot about neuroimaging, affine transformations, and the importance of checking my data step-by-step before
            visualizing results.

    <!-- Future Directions -->
    <section class="card">
        <h2>Future Directions</h2>
        <p>
            This was just my first step into neuroimaging analysis. Moving forward, I’d like to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Improve lesion detection by using machine learning-based segmentation techniques.</li>
            <li>Refine the pre/post MRI alignment to ensure voxel comparisons are accurate.</li>
            <li>Explore how different types of rehabilitation therapies impact brain recovery over time.</li>
        </ul>
